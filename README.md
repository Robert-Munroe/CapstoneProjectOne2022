1. Robert Munroe
2. json should be imported, but no install needed. You will need to install pytest and tkinter

2a. I have an issue with flake8 having an issue with my imports which is causing me to fail to lint.
I have no idea how to get around this issue. Pycharm doesn't even display a possible solution to this flake8 issue.
Pycharm doesn't actually detect this flake8 issue.

3. I have added:
- an update button
- buttons to display tables of movies and tv shows
- buttons to graph pos and negative changes of both movies and shows
- button to show most popular movies and shows in their respective top 250
- test to make sure the data I get from most popular movies in top 250 movies was
formatted correctly

4. I have not added:
- the ability to interact with the table directly
- tests for gui

5. Everything from the previous projects still work
