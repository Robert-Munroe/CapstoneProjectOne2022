2. json should be imported, but no install needed
3. This project pulls the top 250 shows from IMBD's api. 
it then gets the user rankings for the top 1, 50, 100, and 200th
ranked show. It also pulls the user rankings for The Wheel of Time
show. 

More indepth: it'll pull the top 250 shows and automatically get the
tv show's IMBD-id to pull the data from the API for user data. This way I
don't need to hard code TV show's id to better reflect ranking changes over timer. 

4. The only thing that is missing as of the time i'm righting this is:
the ability to write the top 250 shows to a file with a separator. I will attempt
to add this function to the program however, I ran out of API calls for the day and will
require more time to make sure I properly implement this functionality. 

Nothing else is missing from the project.
